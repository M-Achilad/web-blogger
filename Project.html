        <p>The $20 million-per-year deal between Lionel Messi and Socios expands his list of sponsors, which already includes PepsiCo, Budweiser, and Adidas. In a partnership established in June of last year, he also became Hard Rock International's first athlete brand ambassador, enabling Messi to match Cristiano Ronaldo of Manchester United in terms of off-field earnings for the first time since 2013. Messi was named the world's best men's soccer player in 2021 and won the Ballon d'Or in that year, but he has struggled on the field more recently, scoring just nine goals in 32 appearances for Paris Saint-Germain after tallying 38 in 47 games in his final season with Barcelona. However, despite PSG's failure in the Round of 16 of the Champions League, the team won the French Ligue 1 championship in Messi's debut campaign.</p>

He appeared in Space Jam: A New Legacy the previous year, and he recently switched the home of his chat program, The Shop, from HBO to YouTube. Forbes estimates that in October, he sold a sizable minority stake in SpringHill, the production firm behind both projects, for around $725 million, bringing his total wealth to $850 million. James starred alongside a computer-generated version of his younger self in a Super Bowl commercial after establishing an endorsement arrangement with Crypto.com in January. Additionally, he most recently made investments in StatusPRO, a sports technology startup that develops virtual reality training solutions, and Tonal, a home gym company.</p>

        <p>Cristiano Ronaldo, like his adversary Lionel Messi, has struggled in his debut season at Manchester United, who are currently sitting in sixth position in the Premier League standings with one game remaining. There are currently rumors circulating that Ronaldo, who previously played for Manchester United from 2003 to 2009, may move again during the summer transfer window. Ronaldo's extensive social media presence contributes significantly to his income potential: Considering that he has 690 million followers across Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, he has the power to demand exorbitant fees from sponsors like Nike, Herbalife, and Clear shampoo. Additionally, he invests in Tatel eateries, which now have a Beverly Hills location, and is the face of the upcoming app ZujuGP, a future app that seeks to create a virtual soccer community.</p>
